# UCSB-Lasercomms
Scripts from summer research at UCSB in Professor Lubin's laboratory.

Here you will find scripts in C++ corresponding to Arduino codes for an electronic transmitter and receiver of PPM pulses.
Additionally, there are Python scripts that correspond to Reed-Solomon error correction codes. These codes are used to spot and fix errors in the message. These scripts make use of the Python library 'reedsolo'.
There are also some simulations testing the effectiveness of these error correction codes at varying levels of erasures and background noise.
